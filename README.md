# Heart-disease-prediction-model
🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on health-related data. It leverages PyCaret, an open-source low-code ML library, to automate model training, evaluation, and selection.

**📁 Project Structure
**Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb — Main Jupyter notebook with data exploration, model building, and evaluation.

heart_disease_model.pkl — Trained machine learning model saved using PyCaret.

README.md — Project documentation.

🚀 **Features**
Built using PyCaret for rapid model prototyping

Compared multiple models automatically

Evaluated performance using confusion matrix, AUC, accuracy, recall, F1, etc.

Best model: Logistic Regression with ~83% accuracy

Trained model saved for future use or deployment
